# Scala Quest

* CODE as DOCUMENTATION, BUT NOT ALWAYS
* CLEAN & CONSISTENT
* DO MORE WITH COMPILER
* DO MORE AUTOMATION
* MAKE DEPENDENCY EXPLICIT THROUGH FUNCTIONAL CONSTRUCTS
* MICRO SERVICE CENTERED
  * Autonomy
  * Independence
* ACID 2.0
  * ASSOCIATIVE
  * COMMUTATIVE
  * IDEMPOTENT
  * DISTRIBUTED
* SERIALIZABLE (for Spark)


## Scala.js

## Design

* mutation vs fact(event sourcing)
* The object graph should be created as late as possible.

## Common libs

* `juice`
* `read monad`
*

## Configuration

* Read only the things that need to be dynamically loaded from other stuff in that way, not loaded all the other stuff which is fixed.
